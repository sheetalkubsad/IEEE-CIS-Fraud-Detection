#### 📊 Data Description
The dataset consists of two main files:

1️⃣ train_transaction.csv → Transaction-related features (e.g., transaction amount, card type, device info, etc.)

2️⃣ train_identity.csv → Identity-related features (e.g., device type, browser type, etc.)

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
```
Python 3.x → Programming language
Pandas, NumPy → Data processing
Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM → Machine Learning models
Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook → Experimentation
```
